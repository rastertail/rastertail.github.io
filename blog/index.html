<h2 class="m-b0">Hacking VS Code for On-the-Fly Environment Switching</h2>
<h4 class="m-t0 dim">March 27, 2022 - 6 minute read</h4>

    <p>
        <p><strong>Note: This technique no longer works as of VS Code 1.66, presumably due to the upgrade to Electron 17! I intend to find a new solution, but it is not planned any time soon.</strong></p>
<p>In my day-to-day development workflows, I make heavy use of <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes">Nix Flakes</a>; particularly, the development shell feature where I can make a special, reproducable development environment for each of my projects.
To enter a flake environment, you use the <code>nix develop</code> command, which interacts great with terminal editors like Vim.
However, I have recently switched over to using VS Code for my heavy-duty programming, and launching it from a terminal after running <code>nix develop</code> is not the smoothest workflow.
In order to comfortably use VS Code every day, I had to find a better solution.</p>

<h2 class="m-b0">BS-1: Breadboard Synthesizer</h2>
<h4 class="m-t0 dim">September  3, 2021 - 9 minute read</h4>

    <p>
        <p>While I mainly focus on the software side of computers, I have always had an interest in electrical engineering too.
So, after getting burnt out over some programming projects, I decided to try out something a bit different and build some sort of electronic circuit.
I took inspiration from all the breadboard computers people have built, mostly inspired by Ben Eater, but I decided to take a different approach and built an analog synthesizer on breadboards instead.</p>
